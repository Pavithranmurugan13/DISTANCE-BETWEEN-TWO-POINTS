# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
Using import math function,do the calculations.
### Step 2:
Take the two coordinates as l1 and l2.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula

import math
x1, y1 = 4, 2
x2, y2 = 10, 6
distance = math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)
print(f"{distance:.2f}")

```
